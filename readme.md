Purpose:
* This program is a playable game called Sixes Wild. The premise of the game is to create selections of tiles that add to a sum of six (6). Tiles have number values that represent how much they contribute towards a sum of six during a move, as well as a multiplier to increase the move's score.
* There is also a level builder in this project, which is used to create levels that can be played in Sixes Wild. The level builder allows modification of the level settings, from frequencies of tiles to the shape of the board.

Execution:
* To run the level builder, run the main class called "BuilderMain.java". This will open a window that allows user interaction for the builder.
* To run the game application, run the main class called "GameMain.java". This will open a window that allows user interaction for the game.
